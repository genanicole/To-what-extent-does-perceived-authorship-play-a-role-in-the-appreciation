# To what extent does perceived authorship play a role in the appreciation of algorithmically generated poetry in sonnet and haiku poems?
The researcher I collaborated with wanted to approach the question whether authorship plays a role in the appreciation of algorithmically generated poetry in sonnet and haiku poems. The data file had to be cleaned and re-organized to fit the proper format for the hypotheses design. I have initially described the sample using graphs and descriptive statistics. To be able to conduct the analysis, a check to see weather any assumptions were violated was performed. This revealed that data met all of the assumptions required to perform the test. I have proceeded further with the analysis, and performed a Two-Way Mixed ANOVA. The repeated-measures factor was represented by different poem type (Sonnet appreciation and Haiku appreciation) and the between-groups factor represented by appreciation of perceived authorship (Poet Authorship, Machine Learning Algorithm Authorship, and No Authorship).
